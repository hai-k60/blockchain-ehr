          <h4>1. Abstract</h4>
          <p>Electronic medical records (EMRs) are critical, highly sensitive private information in healthcare, and need to be
            frequently shared among peers such as healthcare providers, insurance companies, pharmacies, researchers, patients
            families, among others. Blockchain provides a shared , immutable and transparent history of all the transactions
            to build applications with trust, accountability and transparency. This provides a unique opportunity to develop
            a secure and trustable EMR data management and sharing system using blockchain.</p>
    
          <p>Using blockchain technology for primary patient care can help to address the following problems
            of the current healthcare systems:</p>
    
          <p>A patient often visits multiple disconnected hospitals. He has to keep the history of all his data and maintain the
            updates. This leads to the situation when required information may not be available.</p>
    
          <p>• Due to the unavailability of the data, patient may have to repeat some tests for laboratory results. This is common
            when the results are stored in another hospital and can not be immediately accessed.</p>
          <p>• The healthcare data are sensitive and their management is cumbersome. Yet, there is no privacy-preserving system
            in clinical practice that allows patients to maintain access control policy in an efficient manner.</p>
          <p>• Sharing data between different healthcare providers may require major effort and could be time consuming.</p>
          <p>• Relying on centralized entity that would store and manage the patients’ data and access control policies means having
            single point of failure and a bottleneck of the whole framework.</p>
    
    
          <p>The possibility of using blockchain for healthcare data management has recently raised a lot of attention.In our work,
            we focus on a practical implementation of a system that uses blockchain technology and can be integrated in clinical
            practice. We employ permissioned blockchain technology to maintain metadata and access control policy. Combining these technologies allows us to guarantee data security and
            privacy as well as availability with respect to the access control policy defined by the patient.</p>
    
          <h5>1. Background on Blockchain:</h5>
          <p>Blockchain is a peer-to-peer distributed ledger technology that was initially used in the financial industry. Based
            on how the identity of a user is defined within a network, one could distinguish between permissioned and permissionless
            blockchain systems. A permissionless system is one in which the identities of participants are either pseudonymous
            or even anonymous and every user may append a new block to the ledger. In contrast, in case of a permissioned blockchain,
            the identity of a user is controlled by an identity provider. The identity provider is trusted to maintain access
            control within the network and the user’s rights to participate in the consensus, or validate a new block. Next we
            introduce two most well-known implementations of the blockchain technology: Ethereum and Hyperledger.</p>

          <h5>2. Hyperledger Fabric: </h5>
    
          <p>The Hyperledger blockchain network is permission-based and requires users to sign up to use it. Permissioning on the
            network is controlled using Hyperledger modelling and access control languages. Hyperledger Fabric is a platform
            for distributed ledger solutions underpinned by a modular architecture delivering high degrees of confidentiality,
            resilience, flexibility and scalability. Medical information is often highly sensitive, in both a social and legal
            sense, so a closed blockchain such as Hyperledger Fabric helps to retain the necessary privacy required for such
            an application. Hyperledger Fabric is a better solution for managing access to health records, as it accommodates
            for multiple layers of permission, meaning the owner of a set of data can control which parts of their data is accessed.

          <h5> Potential Blockchain Application in Healthcare:</h5>
          <p>Blockchain provides a unique opportunity to support healthcare. </p>
    
    
          <p>Our EHR Solution enables the user to give healthcare professionals access to their personal health data. EHR Solution
            then records interactions with this data in an auditable, transparent and secure way on systems distributed ledger.</p>
    
    
          <p>Lastly, Our EHR Solution is a platform for others to use that complement and improve the user experience. Users will
            be able to leverage their medical data to power a plethora of applications and services. Our Solution improves care
            for people by placing the patient at the centre of the digital transformation of healthcare. In order to be provided
            with the best care patients not only can, but must have control over their own data.</p>

          <h4>2. Technical Explanation</h4>
    
          <h6># Participants Definitions and Permissions</h6>
    
          <p>With a plethora of different actors, identity management and access to data is key to our EHR solution. A dynamic system
            has been developed that identifies actors and gives them the appropriate scope over a health record, contingent on
            the patient’s permission.</p>
          <p> Below are some examples of read/write permission:</p>
          <table class="table">
            <tr>
              <th>Participant</th>
              <th>Permissions</th>

            <tr>
              <td>Patient</td>
              <td> @ Create/READ/Update Own record

          <h4> 3. Transactions</h4>
    
          <h6>Patient Granting Access</h6>
          <p>• Patient A grants access to EHR to Practitioner A</p>
          <p>• Practitioner A’s ID is added to Patient A’s authorised asset on the ledger</p>
          <p>• Patient A’s ID is added to Practitioner A’s authorised asset on the ledger</p>
          <p>• The Symmetric key for the EHR is decrypted with Patient A’s private key</p>
          <p>• Symmetric key is then encrypted with Practitioner A’s public key </p>
    
          <h6>Patient Revoking Access</h6>
          <p>• Patient A revokes access from Practitioner A</p>
          <p>• Practitioner A’s ID is removed from Patient A’s authorised asset</p>
          <p>• Patient A’s ID is removed from Practitioner A’s authorised asset</p>
          <p>• Patient A’s private key is used to decrypt Symmetric key for EHR which is used to decrypt the EHR</p>
          <p>• The EHR is encrypted with a new Symmetric key</p>
          <p>• The new Symmetric key is encrypted with Patient A’s public key and the public keys of all the remaining IDs that
            have permission
    
    
            <h4>4. Data Structure</h4>
            <p>Hyperledger’s modelling language will be used to define the domain model for the network. Below are some examples
              from the .CTO file of how models will be defined and stored on the chain. These are subject to change depending
              upon different regulations and requirements in order to make the platform HIPPA compliant.</p>

            <h5>User Centric Model</h5>
            <p> the current healthcare system, patients have their health information spread over multiple systems, hospitals, networks
              and potentially countries. There are multiple fragmented records of the same patient, held at different institutions
              with their own snapshot of the patient’s health during their interaction with them such as blood tests, imaging,
              and clinic letters. EHR Solution will order and filter all of these records into a chronological order and the
              specific categories above to aid data handling. Such categorisation would make the records more accessible and
              understandable for patients, and also facilitate researchers in seeking out the information important to them.
              </p>
    
            <h5>Patient Safety:</h5>
    
            <p> A patient can generally grant or decline healthcare professionals access to their records. However, in the event
              of an emergency and with the patient incapacitated, there must be an ability to view certain information in order
              to provide the best possible care. The most vital information needed in an emergency would be the patient’s name,
              their next of kin, medications, allergies and any advanced decisions they may have made. Patients using the platform
              will have the ability to select in advance which areas of their records can be viewed in an emergency situation.
